# Usage in interactive mode (for humans)

1. `cd` in website root directory
2. Execute `bdsm`
3. Follow instructions. Enjoy! See features description below.
4. ~~üí∞ Donate~~. Nah! Just give this repo a star and I will appreciate it! ‚≠êÔ∏è

# Usage with flags (for automation)

`--backup` option is made to simply create DB backup file with name like `my_database_mysql_2019-10-25.sql` and quit. `--backup` option will not open interactive mode.

```shell
bdsm --backup [-d <backups folder>] [-n <backups max count>] [--zip]
```

Example:

```shell
bdsm --backup -d /backups/ -n 14 --zip
```

## Parameters
- `-d` is optional parameter. Use it to specify backups directory. By default, script will use `bd_backups` folder in root of your project (website)
- `-n` is optional parameter. Use it to limit total number of backups. By default, there is no limit. 
- `--zip` is optional parameter. Use it to automatically compress database backups with tar (tar.gz)


You can use **BDSM** as a simple DB backuping tool by putting this to your cron job! I suggest you to use it like this

### Cron jobs

Daily Cron job example:

```shell
0 0 * * * /bin/bash -c "source ~/.gg_tools/bdsm.sh && cd <website path> &&  bdsm --backup -d <backups folder>  --zip "
```

For example, you can keep 7 daily backups, 4 weekly and 6 monthly backups in different folders like this

```shell
WEBSITE_PATH=<website path>
BACKUPS_PATH=/db_backups

# 7 daily backups
0 0 * * * /bin/bash -c "source ~/.gg_tools/bdsm.sh && cd "$WEBSITE_PATH" &&  bdsm --backup -d "$BACKUPS_PATH"/daily -n 7  --zip"

# 4 weekly backups
0 0 * * 0 /bin/bash -c "source ~/.gg_tools/bdsm.sh && cd "$WEBSITE_PATH" &&  bdsm --backup -d "$BACKUPS_PATH"/weekly -n 4 --zip"

# 6 monthly backups
0 0 1 * * /bin/bash -c "source ~/.gg_tools/bdsm.sh && cd "$WEBSITE_PATH" &&  bdsm --backup -d "$BACKUPS_PATH"/monthly -n 6 --zip"
```


where `path/to/your/website` is obviously a path to your website!

## Features (options)

0. When you execute BDSM it will automatically detect you engine, check for config file and parses it to get DB credentials. Then all of that data will be stored in your current Bash session.
1. **Show credentials.** Pretty obvious, isn't it?
2. **Export DB locally.** This option will dump your database into file. If you are using Docker, then you should use option 12 before. See description below.
3. **Search in dump.** This option is responsible for searching in exported DB dump file.
4. **Search/Replace in dump.** Obviously, this option will search/replace any given data. First step will be search, then (optionally) replacement. Please keep in your mind that BDSM doesn't support RegExp for now, only simple string values.
5. **Import dump.** If BDSM successfully determined your DB credentials OR if your entered them manually (option 11), then "Import dump" option will... Guess what? It will import you dump file to database. What a surprise!
6. **Pull DB from remote server.** This is very cool feature that allows you do a bunch of stuff IN ONE RUN! What it will do is:
    1. SSH to a given remote server
    2. Check if there is a Docker container with "mysql" in its name
    3. Depending on previous step it will export DB to dump file from localhost or from Docker container
    4. SCP exported dump to you on you–∫ local machine (depending where you launched BDSM)
    5. Delete exported dump from the remote server
7. **Delete dump.** Deletes local dump.
8. **Self-update.** You can update BDSM to the last version by this option.
9. **Install other scripts.** Convinious way to install or update:
    1. Micro Editor. GUI like editro in your terminal and alias it to "m" command. See more https://micro-editor.github.io/
    2. Hello Bash. My handy Bash prompt configurator. I use it everywhere. See more https://github.com/michaelradionov/helloBash
    3. My awesome Git aliases. See more here https://github.com/michaelradionov/aliases
    4. Other aliases for Jira, Laravel, Docker and other.
10. **Look for dump elsewhere locally.** This option will help you to point BDSM to already existing dump file.
11. **Enter credentials manually.** Manually input DB name, user and password.
12. **Choose/forget local Docker container.** In fact it means "enter Docker mode". Here you can:
    1. Let BDSM to find container with "mysql" in its name
    2. Explicitly input Docker container's name
    3. Quit Docker mode


# Requirements

- **Bash support.** Check by executing `bash --version`
- **Mysql CLI support.** Check by executing `mysql --version` and `mysqldump --version`
- **cURL CLI support.** Check by executing `curl --version`
- **Sourcing ~/.bashrc file** on session start. Check by:
    1. executing `echo 'echo "It works"' >> ~/.bashrc`
    2. then start new terminal session. If you see "It works!" then you good.
    3. Then **delete** this line from your ~/.bashrc.
- For the previous item. If you don't know where is ~/.bashrc, you should execute `cd` (without parameters), then `pwd`. Output will be your home path, it equals `~`.

If you have literally ANY trouble with installing and using script, please, create an issue in Github repo https://github.com/michaelradionov/bdsm.
